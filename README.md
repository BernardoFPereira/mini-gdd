# MiniGDD CLI
Generate a minimal, presenterm-compatible, Game Design Document template on the current directory.
It is recommended to have `presenterm`.

## How to
Create the template file with the supplied name.

`minigdd spawn <game_name>`

If there's no name, the file will be generated with a default one.

Open file with your text editor of choice and edit it's contents.

Run presenterm with your new mini-gdd:

`presenterm <mini-gdd file>`

Check `presenterm` [docs](https://mfontanini.github.io/presenterm/) if you want to customize the document further.

## Mini next steps
1. Add flags to customize the generated file a little better
