# MiniGDD CLI
Generate a minimal, presenterm-compatible, Game Design Document template on the current directory.
I plan on expanding this tool to a somewhat interesting state eventually.

## How to
`minigdd spawn <game_name>`
Generates the template with the supplied name.
If there's no name the file is generated with a default name.

Open file with your text editor of choice and edit it's contents.

Check `presenterm` [docs](https://mfontanini.github.io/presenterm/) if you want to customize the document further.

## Mini next steps
1. Add flags to customize the generated file a little better
